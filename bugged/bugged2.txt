Problem is that there is no dynamic distribution between threads.

Actions:
1. Swap omp barrier and printf, so now it is logically printed.
2. Added initialization to total before parallel section.
3. Made "total" variable shared in parallel section.
4. Added "local" and "tid" variables and made it private in parallel section.
5. Changed "total" to "local" in omp for statement.
6. Added critical section where every thread adds its' local result to total.
