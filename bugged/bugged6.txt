Problem: programm is  not compiling.

Actions:
1. Make "sum" variable global, and delete "sum" variable in dotprod, so now there is no problem with private/shared sum in dotprod and conpiler knows which variables are shared and used in function.
2. Make dotprod void function, so now it only changes global sum and returns nothing.
3. programm works as expected: it returns squares of first 99 natural numbers.
